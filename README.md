# laptop_customizer
  Your task is to refactor this application using what you know about component-based organization. Note the following, however:

The style is not important. Try to keep everything looking the same; if you do break the styles, do not spend too much time trying to fix them. You can copy the existing CSS into new files for better organization, but you should not edit it.
The app works as intended; you only have to reorganize the code that is already there. This will require making new component files, but not much beyond that. If the app does not do something that you think it should, assume those changes can be made later.
Begin this task by breaking down the user interface into components and drawing them as a hierachal tree. You should be able to identify at least 6 components - possibly even more! Once you are satisfied with the component organization, take some time to plan out where the state(s) of the app will live. Finally, create the component files you will need, and move the existing code into those files.
